This personal project focuses on sentiment analysis, with the primary objective of deepening my expertise in handling and interpreting text data. While there is ample opportunity for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and other ancillary tasks, the project maintains a concentrated emphasis on sentiment analysis techniques to build a robust understanding of text-driven insights.
